# React Simplified

**Simplified React Core Mechanisms Illustration**

## Overview

This project provides an educational exploration of React's foundational concepts, focusing on elucidating the core mechanisms that power the React.js library. By building a simplified version of React, it aims to demonstrate that React is a collection of JavaScript functions and concepts, making it more accessible to developers.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this project is intended solely to illustrate React's core principles and is not a full replacement for the React library. It lacks many advanced features and optimizations found in React, including a comprehensive rendering and reconciliation process. This project aims to emphasize simplicity and education rather than production-ready use.

### Project Focus Areas

1. **Virtual DOM**: Explore how the virtual DOM operates and how it optimizes the rendering process in React.

2. **Hooks**: Implement basic versions of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to illustrate their functionality.

3. **Rendering and Reconciliation**: Dive into the rendering and reconciliation process to comprehend how React efficiently updates the user interface.

4. **Component Creation**: Learn how to create components using a simplified version of `createElement`.

Through this project, developers can gain insights into the foundational concepts of React and build a strong foundation for utilizing React effectively in their projects. It emphasizes that React, at its core, is composed of understandable JavaScript functions, dispelling the notion of it being a magical black box.
